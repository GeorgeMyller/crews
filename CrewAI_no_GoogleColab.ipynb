National average salary: $75,515 per year Primary duties: A programmer analyst creates and inserts computer programs and software according to a company's business requirements. This involves writing, coding, testing and analyzing software applications and programs. 4. SQL. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a database manipulation language. It's used for database querying, retrieval, manipulation, and overall communication.SQL is domain-specific and designed mainly to manage and analyze data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).. SQL is also a beginner- and user-friendly language that requires no prior coding skills. Machine learning engineers work on designing, coding, and improving artificial intelligence algorithms. This is one of the highest-paid programming jobs because it is a highly technical and specialized position. Machine learning engineers mostly work as part of a larger data science team.\n",
